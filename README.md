# Counter

The purpose of the project is to provide a counter using plain JavaScript without using frameworks.

## UX

As a user, when I click on the Decrease Button, I expect the value to decrease by 1.

As a user, when I click on the Reset Button, I expect the value to equal 0.

As a user, when I click on the Increase Button, I expect the value to increase by 1.

As a user, I expect the color to be green, when the value is greater than 0.

As a user, I expect the color to be black, when the value equals 0.

As a user, I expect the color to be red, when the value is less than 0.

The counter is an integer (whole number).

## Features

The ability to increase or decrease values as well as setting the value to 0.

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Google Fonts (e.g. Roboto).

## Testing
